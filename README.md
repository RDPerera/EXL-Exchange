# EXL-Exchange
In Sri Lanka, most of the University students intend to have a proper platform to express their skills. Even though there are websites like work.lk , workdesk for freelancing they don’t target undergraduates primarily.
To handle the mentioned issue we are introducing the web application, **“EXL Exchange”**  which stands the meaning **“Experiential Learning”** to connect a buyer and a seller where, 

* Buyer will assign  a job to a seller
* Seller will get the job done
* Buyer will pay the fee to the seller
* Everyone will get equal benefits

## Our Goal

Introducing Freelancing to Sri Lankan undergraduates; by paving the way to learn effectively through experience and maintaining professionalism along with uplifting and overcoming from financial difficulties.

## Objectives

* Increase awareness on freelancing among students
* Build a freelancing community within Sri Lankan universities
* Enhancing the working experience among students
* Improve soft skills such as communication, teamwork, adaptability, creativity etc.
