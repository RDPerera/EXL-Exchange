# EXL-Exchange
In Sri Lanka most of the University students intend to have a proper platform to express their skills. Though there are work.lk workdesk websites for freelancing they don’t target undergraduates specially.
To handle that we are introducing the web application, “EXL Exchange”  Standing the meaning “Experiential Learning” to connect buyer and seller where, 
	Buyer will assign  a job to a seller,
	Seller will get the job done
	Buyer will pay the fee to the seller
	Everyone will get equal benefits
